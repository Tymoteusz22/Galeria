### School Project


The main purpose of the project was to show the difference in loading times between different image_icon loading methods.

The project shows the difference between loading images: directly as icons (all icons show at once, without much code input); pre-calculated icon sizes (all icons show at once); using Glide library (icons show when they are ready).


Presentation (file) purpose was to:
1. Shortly explain 'the circle of life' of the android app activity screen
2. Explain most important project elements (activity screen, glide, shared preferences)
3. Writing a few sample tasks for other participants
